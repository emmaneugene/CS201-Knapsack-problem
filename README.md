## About The Project

We are investigating the classic 0-1 knapsack problem using a range of data structures. We have written solution implmenetations using arrays, 
linked lists, hash maps and balanced search trees.

## Getting Started

Java 13 must be installed on your local machine in order to run the programs.

## Usage

Compile and run individual program files using the data structure you wish to test.

**Example:**

`javac ArraySolution.java`

`java ArraySolution`

When prompted to enter a data path, you may specify any file in the `/datasets` directory.

`Enter a file path: datasets/dataset_6.csv`

Enter the weight limit desired.

`Enter weight limit: 10`

The program should then solve for and print out the optimal combination, as well as program diagnostics.
